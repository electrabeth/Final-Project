# Final-Project
All 110 episodes of Wizards of Waverly Place were examined using 28 variables. The variables examined in this code are “podcast,” “creatures,” “allusions,” “guest,” “rating,” and “seconds.” “Podcast” is a qualitative dummy variable which examines if the episode had a corresponding podcast episode, 1 = yes and 0=no. “Creatures” is a qualitative dummy variable which examines if there was any type of magical creature in the episode, excluding the main characters, and is measured as 1 = yes and 0 = no. “Allusions” is a discrete quantitative variable which measures if there is a widely known reference in the episode, measured as 1, 2, 3, etc…. “Guest” is a discrete quantitative variable that examines if there is a guest star, co-star, or recurring character, measured as 1, 2, 3…. “Rating” is a continuous quantitative variable which measures the rating in stars such as 4.9, 5.0, 5.1, etc…. Finally “seconds” is a continuous quantitative variable which examines how long google took to produce search results from the variable “search” and is measures as 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, etc…. The sample size was all 110 episodes, and no simple random sample was needed, becuase we did the whole population size.
