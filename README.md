# Final-Project
All 110 episodes of Wizards of Waverly Place were examined using 28 variables. The variables examined in this code are “podcast,” “creatures,” “allusions,” “guest,” “rating,” and “seconds.”

# Introduction
To access and utilize the script, open "paranich.R", to access the data set open "data.csv", and to access the codebook open "codebook.pdf". Additionally, to access the plots created from RStudios, open "Box Plot of Allusions and Guests", "Scatter Plot of Ratings and Seconds for Search Results", and "Residuals Plot".

# Data
In this case, a simple random sample is not needed because we collected data on the entire show, both population size and sample size = 110.

# Operationalization 
“Podcast” is a qualitative dummy variable which examines if the episode had a corresponding podcast episode, 1 = yes and 0=no.

“Creatures” is a qualitative dummy variable which examines if there was any type of magical creature in the episode, excluding the main characters, and is measured as 1 = yes and 0 = no.

“Allusions” is a discrete quantitative variable which measures if there is a widely known reference in the episode, measured as 1, 2, 3, etc….

“Guest” is a discrete quantitative variable that examines if there is a guest star, co-star, or recurring character, measured as 1, 2, 3….

“Rating” is a continuous quantitative variable which measures the rating in stars such as 4.9, 5.0, 5.1, etc….

“seconds” is a continuous quantitative variable which examines how long google took to produce search results from the variable “search” and is measures as 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, etc….
